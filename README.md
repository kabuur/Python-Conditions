# Python Conditions

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various examples and concepts related to conditional statements in Python. These scripts showcase the usage and functionality of if statements, elif statements, and else statements, highlighting their importance in controlling the flow of a program based on different conditions.

## Scripts

1. `if_elif_else.py`: This script demonstrates the usage of if, elif, and else statements in Python. It showcases how to define multiple conditions and execute different blocks of code based on the evaluation of those conditions.

2. `if_elif_else_int.py`: This script provides examples of if, elif, and else statements specifically for handling integer-based conditions. It demonstrates how to check for various conditions and perform different actions based on the value of an integer variable.

3. `if_statement.py`: This script focuses solely on the usage of if statements in Python. It illustrates how to check a single condition and execute a block of code if the condition evaluates to true.

4. `boolean_condition.py`: This script showcases examples of boolean conditions in Python. It demonstrates how to use boolean variables and operators to create conditional statements.
